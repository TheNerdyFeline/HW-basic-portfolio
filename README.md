This is my first homework assignment for UCLA Coding Bootcamp. It is an online portoflio, with 3 pages About Me, Portfolio, and Contact sheet. The submit button has not been programmed yet.

## Requirements
-- Make 2 html pages About, Portfolio, and Contact Sheet. (no javascript)
-- Make an assets folder for CSS and Images.
-- Make it look like the images provided.

## Techonologies Used
-- HTML
-- CSS

During the process I had some difficulty getting the portfolio to layer they way I needed, because I was missing the positioning property in the CSS.  I also had to find a way to get the footer to stick to the bottom, and despite following examples online it was being very stubborn.  After loading everything to gh-pages and laucnhing it online I was able to put it through the html validator and after fixing all the errors everything worked.
